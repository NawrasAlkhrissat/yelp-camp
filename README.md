# 🏕️ YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse, create, update, and review campgrounds. This project was built as part of my learning journey through **Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp**. It provided me with hands-on experience in developing RESTful APIs, implementing user authentication, handling file uploads, working with databases, and deploying full-stack applications.
